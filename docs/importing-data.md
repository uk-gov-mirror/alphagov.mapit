# MapIt - import postcode and boundary data

## Introduction

[MapIt](https://github.com/alphagov/mapit) is a product of
[MySociety](https://mysociety.org) which we use within GOV.UK to allow
people to enter their postcode and be pointed to their local services.

It is composed of broadly 2 things:

1.  A database of postcodes and the location of their geographical
    centre
2.  A database of administrative entities (e.g. local councils) and
    their boundaries on a map

When a user enters a postcode on GOV.UK, MapIt will look it up to find
the geographical centre and then return information about the
administrative entities that postcode belongs to. We then use this
information to refer the user to local services provided by those
entities.


## Updating Datasets

Datasets for boundary lines are published twice a year (in May and
October) and postcodes are released four times a year (in February, May,
August and November). This means over time our database will become more
and more out of date and users will start to complain. When they do (or
before if possible) we should update the data.

To update a live mapit server we:

1.  [Generate a new database locally](#generate-a-new-database)
2.  [Export the new database to Amazon S3](#export-new-database-to-s3)
3.  [Update servers with the new database](#update-servers-with-new-database)

### <a name="generate-a-new-database">1. Generate a new database</a>

#### <a name="installation">1.1 Prepare your Mapit installation</a>

Checkout the [mapit](https://github.com/alphagov/mapit),
[mapit-scripts](https://github.com/alphagov/mapit-scripts) and
[govuk-docker](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-docker) repos.

Prepare your Mapit installation in Docker by:
  1.  Running `make mapit` in the `govuk-docker` repo - this will build the image
      and install all the dependencies.
  2.  Reset the database by running `govuk-docker run mapit-app ./reset-db.sh`
      in the `mapit` repo (you can skip this step if you haven't run Mapit locally
      before) - this will drop any existing database, create a new empty one
      and migrate it to the empty schema. See the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)
      section if you have issues.
  3.  Start your Docker container by running `govuk-docker up mapit-app`, and
      check you are able to access `mapit.dev.gov.uk` - it is expected that the
      frontend looks somewhat "broken", that's okay - we only need to worry about
      the database for importing data.


#### <a name="download-latest-data">1.2 Download the latest data from sources</a>

This consists of the [Office for National Statistics Postcode Directory (ONSPD)](https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/search?collection=Dataset&q=ONS%20Postcode%20Directory), [Ordnance Survey Boundary Line (BL)](https://osdatahub.os.uk/downloads/open/BoundaryLine), and [Ordnance Survey of Northern Ireland (OSNI)](http://osni.spatial-ni.opendata.arcgis.com/) datasets.

> MySociety may have mirrored the latest datasets on their cache server: <http://parlvid.mysociety.org/os/> so check there first.

  1. **ONS Postcode Directory** - ONSPD releases can be found via the Office
      for National Statistics (ONS) by going to the [ONS Open Geography
      Portal](https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/search?collection=Dataset&sort=-created&tags=all(PRD_ONSPD))
      then selecting the most recent ONS Postcode Directory.

  2.  **Boundary Line data** - BL releases can be downloaded in ESRI format
      from the [Ordnance Survey (OS)](https://api.os.uk/downloads/v1/products/BoundaryLine/downloads?area=GB&format=ESRI%C2%AE+Shapefile&redirect).

  3.  **ONSI data** - For the ONSI data we now point to Mysociety's URL in the
      [check-onsi-downloads](https://github.com/alphagov/mapit-scripts/blob/master/check-osni-downloads#L18) script, as there have not been any changes since December 2015.
      It's still worth checking if there are any updates. See [about datasets](./docs/about-datasets.md) for more information.

Save the files you have downloaded to your `~/govuk/mapit` directory. This will
make them available in Docker at `/govuk/mapit`. Ensure the rules in `.gitignore`
cover the files you have downloaded, to stop them being erroneously commited to
Git.

#### <a name="update-url-paths">1.3 Update paths in data import scripts</a>

Update the [import-uk-onspd](https://github.com/alphagov/mapit-scripts/blob/master/import-uk-onspd)
script in `mapit-scripts` to refer to the paths of the new releases you have
downloaded to `~/govuk/mapit`.

**Note:** If the ONSI data has been updated and uploaded to S3 update the
[check-onsi-downloads](https://github.com/alphagov/mapit-scripts/blob/master/check-osni-downloads#L18) script to refer to the new S3 URL.


#### <a name="run-import-script">1.4 Start running the import script</a>

In your Mapit directory run the `import-uk-onspd` script to import the data using Docker:

    $ govuk-docker run mapit-app ../mapit-scripts/import-uk-onspd

>This is a long process, it's importing 1000s of boundary objects and
\~2.6 million postcodes, and **takes at least 4.5 hours to run**. The first hour is
particularly important to monitor as this is when it has typically failed
in the past.

If the scripts fail you'll have to investigate why and possibly
update it to change how we import the data.

Some suggestions of places to look for help:
- [Mysociety's documentation](https://mapit.mysociety.org/docs/)
- [Mapit's logged issues](https://github.com/mysociety/mapit/issues)
- [Notes about the previous data import](/HISTORY.md)

Also see the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section for past issues.

If you do have to fix the import scripts, or create new ones, consider
talking with Mysociety developers to see if they're aware and if you can push
those changes back upstream.

> **Note:** If the script fails, you'll need to drop and recreate
the database by running the `reset-db.sh` script and then run `import-uk-onspd`
again. If you have database issues see the [troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)
section.


#### <a name="check-missing-codes">1.5 Check for missing codes</a>

The ONS used to identify areas with SNAC codes (called ONS
in mapit). They stopped doing this in 2011 and started using GSS
codes instead. New areas will not receive SNAC codes, and (for the
moment at least) much of GOV.UK relies on SNAC codes to link
things up, for example [Frontend's AuthorityLookup](https://github.com/alphagov/frontend/blob/master/lib/authority_lookup.rb).

The `import-uk-onspd` script's last action is to run a script to show missing codes.
It's the line that reads

    $MANAGE mapit_UK_show_missing_codes

This iterates over all area types we care about and lists those that
are missing a GSS code (hopefully none) and how many are missing an
ONS/SNAC code. If it lists any areas that are missing codes and you
don't expect them (run the script on production or integration if
you're not sure) you'll need to investigate.

SSH into one of the machines and run:

    gds govuk c ssh -e integration mapit
    $ cd /var/apps/mapit
    $ sudo -u deploy govuk_setenv mapit venv3/bin/python manage.py mapit_UK_show_missing_codes

Then compare the output with that generated in your local Docker container.

An example of the output (May 2019 data) - import looks good:

        Show missing codes

        11874 areas in current generation (1)

        Checking ['EUR', 'CTY', 'DIS', 'LBO', 'LGD', 'MTD', 'UTA', 'COI'] for missing ['ons', 'gss', 'govuk_slug']
        12 EUR areas in current generation
          2 EUR areas have no ons code:
            Northern Ireland 11874 (gen 1-1) Northern Ireland
            Scotland 9199 (gen 1-1) Scotland
        26 CTY areas in current generation
        192 DIS areas in current generation
        33 LBO areas in current generation
        11 LGD areas in current generation
        36 MTD areas in current generation
        109 UTA areas in current generation
        1 COI areas in current generation

An example of the output (November 2020 data) - import has some flagged issues:

        11870 areas in current generation (1)

        Checking ['EUR', 'CTY', 'DIS', 'LBO', 'LGD', 'MTD', 'UTA', 'COI'] for missing ['ons', 'gss', 'govuk_slug']
        12 EUR areas in current generation
          2 EUR areas have no ons code:
            Northern Ireland 11870 (gen 1-1) Northern Ireland
            Scotland 9195 (gen 1-1) Scotland
        25 CTY areas in current generation
        188 DIS areas in current generation
        33 LBO areas in current generation
        11 LGD areas in current generation
        36 MTD areas in current generation
        110 UTA areas in current generation
          1 UTA areas have no ons code:
            Buckinghamshire Council 1767 (gen 1-1) England
          1 UTA areas have no govuk_slug code:
            Buckinghamshire Council 1767 (gen 1-1) England
        1 COI areas in current generation

Note the last few lines where it says Buckinghamshire Council has no `ons` code or `govuk_slug` code.
You may have output similar to this if these councils have had some updates, and
you will have to make some additional updates in the code:

  - Missing ONS/GSS codes are added in [mapit_UK_add_missing_codes.py](https://github.com/alphagov/mapit/blob/main/mapit_gb/management/commands/mapit_UK_add_missing_codes.py), see [this example](https://github.com/alphagov/mapit/commit/532f3e88ce0f5dea64b8f7eede6fb80605648e21)
  - An ONS/GSS code might need to be updated, or council names updated/removed in [authorities.json](https://github.com/alphagov/mapit/blob/main/mapit_gb/data/authorities.json), see [this example](https://github.com/alphagov/mapit/commit/b4d96ffa6160cfa9a8414383b96e6f1a8fa01b71)
  - If there are merged/abolished authorities, to prevent it from being flagged in the
  next import's output (and potentially add to the confusion), you can add them to the
  exception list in [mapit_UK_add_override_names_to_local_authorities.py](https://github.com/alphagov/mapit/blob/main/mapit_gb/management/commands/mapit_UK_add_override_names_to_local_authorities.py#L41) and [mapit_UK_add_slugs_to_local_authorities.py](https://github.com/alphagov/mapit/blob/main/mapit_gb/management/commands/mapit_UK_add_slugs_to_local_authorities.py#L36). You can also check if the authority
  is still active on [https://findthatpostcode.uk](https://findthatpostcode.uk/areas/E07000191.html)

You will have to reset the db and re-import the data again.
Once these have been updated, the API will return the new GSS code, albeit mislabelled as an ONS code.

**Note** [Licensify](https://github.com/alphagov/licensify) also depends on knowledge of SNAC codes to build it's own API paths. It will be necessary to update this [file](https://github.com/alphagov/licensify/blob/master/common/app/uk/gov/gds/licensing/model/SnacCodes.scala) with the new GSS codes and corresponding area.


#### <a name="test-postcodes">1.6 Test some postcodes</a>

If you've had users complaining that their postcode isn't
recognised, then try _those_ postcodes and any other ones
you know. You can get latest postcodes from [https://checkmypostcode.uk/date/](https://checkmypostcode.uk/date/)
and test them on your local database:

    $ curl http://mapit.dev.gov.uk/postcode/ME206QZ

You should expect a `200` response with data present in the `areas`
field of the response. See [this example output](https://github.com/alphagov/mapit#to-fetch-information-about-a-single-postcode)
for an idea of what to expect.

You can also compare the response to existing data we have in one of our environments
and on Mysociety.

    $ curl https://mapit.integration.govuk-internal.digital/postcode/ME206QZ
    $ curl https://mapit.mysociety.org/postcode/ME206QZ

>Ensure you test postcodes from **all parts of the UK**, since Northern
Ireland data has been loaded separately.


#### <a name="make-prs">1.7 Make PRs for any changes you had to make</a>

You will have changed the [import-uk-onspd](https://github.com/alphagov/mapit-scripts/blob/master/import-uk-onspd) and [check-onsi-downloads](https://github.com/alphagov/mapit-scripts/blob/master/check-osni-download)
scripts to refer to new datasets. If anything failed you may have had
to change other things in the mapit repo too.


### <a name="export-new-database-to-s3"> 2. Export new database to S3</a>

Export the database you just built in your Docker container:

    $ govuk-docker run mapit-app pg_dump -U postgres mapit | gzip > mapit.sql.gz

**It should be \~500Mb in size.** You'll want to give it a name that refers
to what data it contains. Perhaps `mapit-<%b%Y>.sql.gz` (using
`strftime` parlance) for a standard release, or
`mapit-<%b%Y>-<a-description-of-change>.sql.gz` if you've had to change
the data outside the normal dataset releases.

Create a new publicly readable directory in S3 for this import and upload the file:

```
DATE=`date '+%Y-%m'`
gds aws govuk-production-poweruser aws s3api put-object --acl public-read --bucket govuk-custom-formats-mapit-storage-production --key source-data/${DATE}/
gds aws govuk-production-poweruser aws s3 cp mapit-<%b%Y>-<a-description-of-change>.sql.gz s3://govuk-custom-formats-mapit-storage-production/source-data/${DATE}/ --acl public-read
```

### <a name="test-a-server-in-staging">3. Test a server in Staging</a>

**NB: THIS REQUIRES ACCESS TO GOV.UK PRODUCTION**

1. Update `import-db-from-s3.sh` to refer to your new file, see [this example PR](https://github.com/alphagov/mapit/pull/58/files).

1. Deploy your change to staging using [the links in the Release app](https://release.publishing.service.gov.uk/applications/mapit).

1. Choose a random node that will be used for testing and note the name (e.g. `ip-10-12-4-139.eu-west-1.compute.internal`):

   ```
   $ gds govuk c ssh -e staging jumpbox 'govuk_node_list -c mapit'
   ```

1. SSH into the node and stop any Postgres instances, then restart (to terminate any connections):

   ```
   sudo service postgresql stop
   ps aux | grep postgresql
   sudo kill -9 <pid>
   sudo service postgresql start
   ```

1. Use a [fabric script](https://github.com/alphagov/fabric-scripts/blob/master/mapit.py#L10) to update the database:

   ```
   $ fab staging-aws -H <node_name> mapit.update_database_via_app
   ```

1. [Clear the shared cache](https://docs.publishing.service.gov.uk/manual/mapit-caches.html) for that instance.

1. Follow the instructions in [Testing a server with an updated Mapit database](/testing-server.md).


### <a name="update-servers-with-new-database">4. Update production servers with new database</a>

Now that you are happy with the changes in `staging`, you can now follow update
the servers in `production` by performing the process for staging on each
production node.

> **Note: Only deploy this change to production once the new data has been tested
in staging. If a new Mapit machine gets created in AWS, it will automatically
try importing the data from the new database.**

Remember to clear the shared cache otherwise old data may still be served.
Refer to [these
docs](https://docs.publishing.service.gov.uk/manual/mapit-caches.html) on how
to clear the cache.

## Troubleshooting

### Useful database queries

- Find area by name

        $ mapit=> select * from mapit_area where name = 'Abbey';

- Find area by id

        $ mapit=> select * from mapit_area where id=1767;
- Find authority by name

        $ mapit=> select * from mapit_name where name like 'Buckinghamshire%';

### Unable to drop the database when running the ./reset-db.sh script

1. Log into the database

         $ python ./manage.py dbshell
2. Prevent future connections by running

        $ REVOKE CONNECT ON DATABASE mapit FROM public;
3. Terminate all connections to the database except your own:

        $ SELECT pid, pg_terminate_backend(pid) FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE datname = current_database() AND pid <> pg_backend_pid();

Failing that, stop `collectd`, it probably connects again the moment the old connection gets terminated:

    $ sudo service collectd stop

### Hitting exceptions where an area has a missing parent or spelt incorrectly

If you see something similar to:

  ```
  get() returned more than one area -- it returned 2!
  /var/govuk/mapit/mapit/management/find_parents.py:49
  Exception: Area Moray [9325] (SPC) does not have a parent?
  ```

or:

  ```
  Exception: ONS code S17000011 is used for Highland and Islands PER and Highlands and Islands PER
  ```

Compare the entry with the database in `integration` or `staging` to identify what
information is missing or needs to be corrected. Searching for the data on
https://mapit.mysociety.org and checking the [logged issues on Mysociety's repo](https://github.com/mysociety/mapit/issues)
might also be helpful. Also see [useful database queries](#useful-database-queries).

You can also search for the area by its ONS code on the ONS website e.g.
http://statistics.data.gov.uk/atlas/resource?uri=http://statistics.data.gov.uk/id/statistical-geography/S17000011

You can manually fix it by adding a correction in [mapit/management/find_parents.py](https://github.com/alphagov/mapit/blob/main/mapit/management/find_parents.py). See [this example](https://github.com/alphagov/mapit/commit/5b2ede155a157d7d69883a6a0197513bcbcca4bb)
and [this example](https://github.com/alphagov/mapit/pull/70/files#diff-8e70109ed476fd7c998d2cd2a051297478b15d926e4c4d7645361197276292eeR203)
